Hi

There are a lot of files in here used for development, some where lost by accident but
the main ones are still here

The core files of the project submitted for marking are:

-DrinksWebServer.py
-Queue_Controller.py
-GPIO_processor.py
-DB_ControllerV2.py
-CreateDrinktionaryDB.py

The accompanying android client app can be found at:
