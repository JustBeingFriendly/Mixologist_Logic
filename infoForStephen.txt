I) Line: 5
  make sure all the imports are the correct ones

II) Line: 8,9,10 
  make sure that the initial variables are set to what you wnat them to be.
  
III) Line: 12, 13
  to make this script link witht he DB we have to install bottle-sqlite, 
  should be able to pip install bottle-sqlite otherwise checkout - 
  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bottle-sqlite/
  
IV) Line: 182,183,184
  check my setup / import of the list with the tuples in it because it 
  looks slightly different to the one i used as an example.
  
V) Line: 230,235,249,263 
  not really anything to check, thses are just the lines calling the 
  cancelations form the list. 

NotaBene// to implement this file, just place in the directory with the other  app server and run as normal, should be good as gold :) The part im most nervous about is the way i get the lists from your script, thats task number IV above other than that shes all good when i test it here. Also i provided a copy of the bottle.py in case you needed it
